// Using makefiles to build
/* 
When you run the following command:
$ make ex1
or
$ CFLAGS="-Wall" make ex1

the program asks and does the following:

1. Does the file ex1 exist already?
2. No. Okay, is there  another files that start with ex1?
3. Yes, it's called ex1.c. Do I know how to build .c files?
4. Yes, I run this command, cc ex1.c -o ex1 to build them.
5. I shall make you one ex1 by using cc to build it from ex1.c


The second command : CFLAGS="-Wall" make ex1
is the way to pass "modifiers" to the make command.

Depending upon the UNXI shell, we can create those "environment variables" 
that will be picked up by programs only when they run.

In the above caommand, command line option -Wall to the cc command 
that make normally runs.
